<h2>Introduction</h2>
<h3>Purpose</h3>
<li> Hair Sylists across New Zealand still use paper cards to document client information. My goal is to create an application that allows stylists to store this information digitally </li>
<li> My application will not only allow Hair Stylists to have all of their information in one tidy system it will also reduce the use of paper and contribute to lowering paper wasteage (even if only a little.) </li>
<li> There are different applications for stylists but none I have found that are specifically database. </li>
Industry/ domain
<li> The industry is Hair and Beauty. </li>
<li>The hair and beauty industry is mainly comprised of small hair salons dotted across the country. Most are locally owned by experienced stylists with an already active client base. </li>
<li> This project is unlikely to be relevant to other industries as itâ€™s sole design is for the hair/beauty industry. However the potential for it to be used in other industries is there if there is need or demand to innovate. </li>

<h2>Product Description </li>

<h2>User Flow</h2>
<h3>Wireframe Design<h3> 
I have created a chart using Mermaid (left) and also have set up a UI with both a light and dark theme. I decided to keep the UI as simple as possible for ease of use for the users.  I plan to add more themes and features within this project but I have built a basic UI and theme for demonstrational purposes.

Non-functional Requirements
<li>Key security requirements are a Login and Registration file with a Password based lock. I am considering implementing a reCAPTCHA authenticator in this project but this is not a definite as of writing this plan. </li>
<li>This application will not feature any transactional features as it is mainly a database. </li>
</li>It needs to be as basic and easy to use as possible. The consumer will need an easy to access and simple application to work with during their busy work days. </li>
<li> It should be quick to respond and have as short of a delay as possible.<li>
<li>Like most applications it must be reliable, it must be able to successfully carry out the required functions and client needs</li>
    
<h2>Project Planning</h2>
<h3>My Roadmap for this project is as follows: </h3>
<li>Build the Front and Back end for this project separately.</li>
</li>Starting with the Front end. I will build this using react and MDN, building the front end first will make it easier for me to create and merge the Back end.</li>
For now I have set up a basic format for the front end however I will begin adding more features and options, tidying it up and making it look more presentable as well as adding additional themes.
<li>Next, the Back end. Once the front end is complete, I will work on developing the back end of the project. This includes setting up an account page as well as the authentication systems (login. Register etc) I will also need to create a system that allows the users to add and remove data as well as navigate through said data.</li>
<li>At the moment I have set up files and documents that allow a login, registration as well as adding and removing clients, appointments and services. I plan to add a products feature within the backend using an API that allows the user to search for and add products that they may supply to their database. </LI>

Testing Strategy
<li>>I will be using dev tools and applications such as Bruno to test my project. </li>
<li>The front end of my project will be tested using Dev tools as well as the NPM testing features to ensure full functionality and usability. For the Backend I shall be testing that with the Bruno application as I find this easier to use than applications such as postman. </li>
